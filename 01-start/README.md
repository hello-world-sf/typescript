# Start

There are two main goals of TypeScript:

* Provide an _optional type system_ for JavaScript.
* Provide planned features from future JavaScript editions to current JavaScript engines

## Tasks

* Convert `cat.js` to a fully typed TypeScript module
* Convert `tree.js` to a fully typed TypeScript module

## Notes

This project is configured using `tsconfig.json`, found in the root directory.

You will need Typings installed to get definitions for NPM modules.

```sh
npm i -g typings
typings install <package> -S
```
